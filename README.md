## The open source tools I use on daily basis:
* Manjaro Distro ([I use Arch btw](https://www.redbubble.com/people/rodebubbel/works/31716594-i-use-arch?p=sticker))
* NeoVim (story [1](https://bit.ly/2MQSAh3))
* Spacemacs
* Org-mode
* zsh
* i3wm
* Tmux

## For R, Python, and Julia programming I use:
[Nvim-R](https://github.com/jalvesaq/Nvim-R) for R and
[vimcmdline](https://github.com/jalvesaq/vimcmdline) for python and julia.
They are lightweight yet powerful IDE to write and run code inside neovim
environment.  

## For math modeling I use:
[Minizinc](https://github.com/MiniZinc) and [JuMP](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl) to model
optimization problem, and [COINOR-CBC](https://github.com/coin-or/Cbc) as
default open-source solver, [Cplex](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer) and [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) in commercial/academic setting.
