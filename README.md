# dotfiles
# The dotfiles include tools I use for data modeling related project such as:
* Tmux
* NeoVim
* zsh

## R and python programming
I use [Nvim-R](https://github.com/jalvesaq/Nvim-R) and [vimcmdline](https://github.com/jalvesaq/vimcmdline).
They are minimal tools to write and run code inside neovim enviroment.
